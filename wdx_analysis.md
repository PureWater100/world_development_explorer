# TITLE 

## The purpose of this paper is to explore how societal culure affects the economies of the four most economically powerful countries in the world, during the time frame of 2010 - 2018. 
## These countries are the United States, China, Germany, and Japan. 
## The focus of this analysis is to compare these four countries in relation to one another.  

## This study is significant because it will give insight into how a country's culture can impact their economic success.
## Furthermore, a country's economic success is critical, as it is an important factor that decides their position on the world stage. 
## Besides these political connotations, this relationship between culture and economic success could potentially establish a direct linkage between individual citizens' ways of life and standards of living. 

## In this study, I am using three indicators to represent the societal culture:

### Masculinity vs. femininity (MAS)
### This measures the preference of that country's society for masculine traits vs. feminine traits. The higher it is, 
### This can also refer to the distribution of roles between men and women
### The higher this value, the more masculine the society is 

### Power Distance index (PDI)
### This index measures the degree to which the less powerful members of society accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. 
### The higher the index, the higher this degree. 

### Adjusted net national income per capita (annual % growth)
### The country's adjusted net natioanl income per citizen is taken as a percentage of growth per year.
### Why is it important to you and/or to others?

## This begs the question, is there a relationship between the three indicators of these four countries? If so, then what kind of relationship is there?
## Additionally, how do these three indicators relate to each other?
## Are there any historic trends?
## Through comparing and constrasting the indicators for different countries, what are the implications?

## In order to answer these questions, I will use three charts:

### Bubble: to explore relations between different topics/indicators
### Line: to look at the historic trend to spot any changes
### Bar: to compare different countries and show similarities/differences and their implcations

## Conclusion:

### From various analyses such as bubble, line, and bar charts the conclusion is that in regards to the PDI, there appears to be a small positive linear trend that can be found between the PDI and growth rate. 
### However, the MAS does not appear to have any significant correlation with either the growth rate or PDI.
### Lastly, we must consider that China's larger growth rate is due to various other causes at play, of which may not be correlated with the MAS or PDI. 
other causes?

## Analysis

### Using Bubble charts, we can see that yes, there is a relationship. 
### Here is a bubble chart for 2010:
### ![](charts/bubble_2010.png)
### We can see that there is very clear positive linear relationship between the power distance index and the adjusted net national income per capita (annual % growth).
### As the annual % growth increases, so does the power distance index.
### Thus, the data suggests that as a country's annual % growth increases, so does their power index. 

### The size of the bubble represents the ratio of masculinity to feminitiy values in that country. 
### However, the bubble size doesn't appear to have any trend, or correlation to the other two variables.
### Thus, the data suggests that this variable does not have a significant impact or relationship to a country's power distance index or annual % growth. 

### As time goes on, the trend becomes less defined:
### Here is a bubble chart for 2018:
### ![](charts/bubble_2018.png)
### However, we are still able to identify a slight positive linear trend, even though it is not as apparent as in 2010. 

### Using Line charts, we can see the historical trends.
### The power index and masculinity vs. femninity values have both remained constant values from 2010-2018
### However, the annual % growth has dynamic changes:
### ![](charts/line_growth.png)

### We can see that for three of the countries (United States, Japan, and Germany) the fluctuations are within a relative level, that being in a 0-4% range.  
### What is interesting is China, whose growth rate is fluctuating at a level that is way above these other three countries.
### What's more, from 2017 - 2018 it shows China's growth rate skyrocketing. 
### Meanwhile for the other three, Japan and Germany's growth rates are actually decreasing. The United States does show an increasing growth rate, but it's a very modest incline. 
### Thus, we need to consider China's huge growth rate as compared to the rest of the countries when we think about the other indicators. 

### Using Bar Charts, we can compare and constrast the indicators for different countries. From this, we can also see the implications.

### Here is a bar chart of the power distance index and MAS for these four countries. There is no change from 2010-2018:
### ![](charts/bar_PDI.png)
### ![](charts/bar_MAS.png)

### Here is the bar chart of the annual % growth in 2010:
### ![](charts/bar_growth_2010.png)
### Compare this to 2018:
### ![](charts/bar_growth_2018.png)
### We see that in 2010, China's growth rate was significantly higher than the three other countries. 
### As of 2018, we can see that the gap between China's growth rate with that of the other countries has gotten even bigger.
